Please ensure, that the file '~/.aws/credentials', has the following contents:

[default]
aws_access_key_id=
aws_secret_access_key=
aws_session_token=


The above credentials can be obtained from the 'AWS IAM Identity Center':


1) Sign in to your AWS account.
2) Open the 'IAM Identity Center' console.
3) Choose 'Dashboard'.
4) Once 'Dashboard' is visible, there should be a URL with the name 'AWS access portal URL', copy this URL.

5) Access the 'AWS Access Portal' via the copied URL and sign in, using your 'AWS IAM Account' credentials.
   
   Please note, to sign in to the 'AWS Access Portal' that was accessed via the copied URL, one must use
   credentials configured in the 'AWS IAM Identity Center', and _not_ the credentials of the 'AWS root Account'.
   
   To sign in to the 'AWS Access Portal', please either use an existing 'AWS IAM Identity Center' account,
   or create a new one specifically for this role.

6) Once signed in to the 'AWS Access Portal' with the appropriate 'AWS IAM Account' credentials,
   there will be various 'AWS' accounts listed. Select an account of interest, and then click
   on the resulting link, named:
   
   'Command line or programmatic access'.
   
   It may be hidden from view, and require that one clicks on an arrow button to reveal it.

7) This will result in a popup web element, wherein various options will be presented as to how
   one can authenticate with 'AWS'. On the resulting popup, choose 'Option 2', with the name:
   
   'Option 2: Manually add a profile to your AWS credentials file (Short-term credentials)'.
   
   It may be hidden from view, and require that one clicks on an arrow button to reveal it.
   The revealed web element will have an actionable region titled 'Click to copy this text'.
   The credentials presented in the revealed text, will need to the copied into the file:
   
   '~/.aws/credentials'

8) The copied text will be a section of an 'INI' file, wherein the heading will have the
   following form:
   
   [<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>_<IAM_ACCOUNT_NAME>]
   
   This section is just a name, and can be changed to an arbitrary string. However,
   presently, the setup requires that authentication keys are stored in a section
   named 'default'.
   
   Therefore, please ensure that the copied 'AWS IAM Identity Center' credentials
   are saved in the section named 'default' in the file '~/.aws/credentials'.

9) Access can be verified by issuing the following command using the 'aws-cli' package:
   
   $ aws s3 ls
   
   Please note, for the above command to succeed, the 'AWS IAM Identity Center' credentials
   in addition to being valid, must also be authorized for the requested access; in this case
   the authorization to list 'S3' buckets.
   
   Please further note, that 'AWS' credentials are by default configured to expire after a few hours.
   
   The above command will fail with an error similar to the one below, if invoked with expired credentials.
   
   'An error occurred (ExpiredToken) when calling the ListBuckets operation: The provided token has expired.'
   
   If an error such as this occurs, simply ensure that the file '~/.aws/credentials' contains up-to-date information.
   
   The package 'aws-cli' can be configured to retrieve the credentials automatically, but one can also obtain
   them again, simply by refreshing the 'AWS Access Portal' site, and re-visiting the link (see step 6):
   
   'Command line or programmatic access'
